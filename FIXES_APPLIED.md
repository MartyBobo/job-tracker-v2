# Fixes Applied to Job Tracker

## Registration Issue Fix
**Problem**: Frontend sends `firstName` and `lastName`, but backend expected `fullName`

**Solution**:
1. Updated `RegisterRequest` DTO to accept `firstName` and `lastName`
2. Updated `RegisterRequestValidator` to validate both fields separately
3. Modified `AuthEndpoints.Register` to combine names into `fullName` when creating user
4. Added `firstName` and `lastName` computed properties to `UserDto`
5. Added logging for better debugging

## Icon.svg Issue Fix
**Problem**: Icon file was not accessible in Docker container

**Solution**:
1. Added explicit volume mount for public folder in `docker-compose.yml`
2. This ensures static files are properly served by Next.js in Docker

## Testing
After rebuilding with `docker-compose up --build`, you should be able to:
1. Register new users with firstName/lastName
2. Login with registered credentials
3. No more 500 errors for icon.svg

## Test Commands
```bash
# Windows
test-registration.bat

# Or manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5250/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe"}'
```
