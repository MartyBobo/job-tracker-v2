# Puppeteer Debug Report - Job Tracker Application

## Test Date: 2025-07-10

## Summary
I've tested the registration and login flow of the Job Tracker application using Puppeteer. The registration works correctly, but there's an issue with the login flow where authentication tokens are not being properly stored in localStorage.

## Test Results

### 1. Docker Container Status ✅
- Frontend container: Running on port 3000
- Backend container: Running on port 5250
- Both containers are healthy and responding

### 2. Registration Flow ✅
- Successfully navigated to registration page
- Filled out form with test data:
  - First Name: Test
  - Last Name: User
  - Email: test_1752143949@example.com
  - Password: TestPass123!
- Registration completed successfully
- User was redirected to login page after registration

### 3. Login Flow ❌
- Login form filled correctly
- Backend API returns 200 OK response
- However, authentication tokens are NOT being stored in localStorage
- Subsequent API calls fail with 401 Unauthorized

## Issue Details

### Root Cause
The login endpoint is working correctly on the backend (returns 200 OK), but the frontend is not properly handling the response to:
1. Extract the accessToken and refreshToken from the response
2. Store them in localStorage
3. Redirect to the dashboard

### Backend Logs
```
[10:40:41 INF] User logged in: test_1752143949@example.com
[10:40:41 INF] HTTP POST /api/auth/login responded 200
[10:40:41 INF] Authorization failed. These requirements were not met:
DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement: Requires an authenticated user.
```

### Frontend State
- localStorage.getItem('accessToken') returns null
- localStorage.getItem('refreshToken') returns null
- User remains on login page after successful backend authentication

## Recommendations

1. **Check the login response handling** in `/frontend/app/auth/login/page.tsx`:
   - Verify the response structure matches what the backend returns
   - Ensure tokens are being extracted correctly from response.data
   - Check for any JavaScript errors in the console

2. **Verify API response format**:
   - The frontend expects `{ accessToken, refreshToken }` in the response
   - Confirm the backend returns this exact structure

3. **Debug the auth flow**:
   - Add console.log statements in the login handler
   - Check browser developer tools Network tab for the actual response
   - Verify no CORS issues are blocking the response

## Screenshots Captured
1. `registration-page-initial` - Initial registration page
2. `registration-form-filled` - Registration form with data
3. `registration-result` - After registration (redirected to login)
4. `login-form-filled` - Login form with credentials
5. `login-result-dashboard` - After login attempt (still on login page)

## Next Steps
The main issue is that the frontend login handler is not properly processing the successful login response from the backend. This needs to be debugged by examining the actual response structure and the client-side code that handles it.

## Update: Fix Implementation Results

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Backend JSON Serialization**: Configured ASP.NET Core to use camelCase JSON serialization
2. ✅ **Frontend Auth Store**: Updated User interface to match backend response (id, email, fullName)
3. ✅ **Added Console Logging**: Added debug statements to login handler

### Test Results After Fixes:
- Backend now correctly returns camelCase JSON response
- Manual curl test shows correct response format:
  ```json
  {
    "accessToken": "...",
    "refreshToken": "...",
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "email": "test_1752143949@example.com",
      "fullName": "Test User"
    }
  }
  ```
- However, the frontend login still fails - tokens are not stored in localStorage
- React appears to be properly hydrated (form has React event handlers)
- No console.log output is visible, suggesting the login handler may not be executing

### Remaining Issue:
The form submission appears to not be triggering the JavaScript handler. Despite React being loaded and event handlers being attached, the form submission doesn't execute the `onSubmit` handler. This could be due to:
1. A JavaScript error preventing the handler from running
2. An issue with the form's event binding
3. A problem with the React Hook Form setup

Further debugging is needed to identify why the form submission handler is not executing.
